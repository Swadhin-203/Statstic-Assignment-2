    "\n",

    "Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the\n",
    "central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "Ans:The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency, which are used to describe the central value or typical value of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of values. It is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers, which can significantly affect its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from lowest to highest. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, but it still considers all the values in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the most common value in a dataset. It is the value that appears most frequently. The mode can be useful when there are a few values that occur more frequently than others, but it is not always applicable or unique. If no value occurs more than once, there is no mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose the appropriate measure of central tendency, you should consider the distribution of the dataset and the presence of outliers. If the dataset is normally distributed and does not have outliers, the mean is a good measure of central tendency. If the dataset has outliers or is skewed, the median may be a better measure of central tendency. If the dataset has categorical data or discrete data, the mode may be a more appropriate measure of central tendency."

    "Ans:Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread of a dataset by providing information about how far the values are from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the highest and the lowest values in the dataset. It gives an idea of the extent of the spread of the data. For example, if the range of a dataset is 20, it means that the highest value is 20 more than the lowest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences of each value from the mean. It gives a measure of how much the values deviate from the mean. A higher variance indicates that the values are more spread out from the mean.\n",

    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average amount of deviation of the values from the mean. It is the most commonly used measure of dispersion, and it gives an idea of how much the values vary from the mean.\n",
    "\n",

    "[65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90]\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:Skewness in data refers to the extent to which the data is asymmetrical or skewed in one direction or the other from a normal or symmetric distribution. In other words, it measures the degree to which the data deviates from a perfectly symmetrical bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data is perfectly symmetrical, the skewness is zero. If the data is skewed to the right, it has a positive skewness, meaning that the tail of the distribution is longer on the right side than on the left side. If the data is skewed to the left, it has a negative skewness, meaning that the tail of the distribution is longer on the left side than on the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness can have important implications for statistical analysis because it can affect the validity of certain assumptions and tests. For example, if the data is significantly skewed, the mean may not be a representative measure of central tendency, and other measures such as the median or mode may be more appropriate. In addition, skewed data can affect the accuracy of some statistical tests, such as the t-test, which assumes a normal distribution"

    "\n",
    "Ans:If a data is right skewed, then the median will be less than the mean. This is because in a right-skewed distribution, the tail of the distribution extends to the right (positive values) and the mean is influenced by the presence of the extreme values in the tail. These extreme values in the right tail pull the mean towards the right and make it larger than the median. The median, on the other hand, is not affected by the extreme values in the tail and represents the midpoint of the dataset. As a result, it is less than the mean in a right-skewed distribution.\n"
