    "The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from lowest to highest. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, but it still considers all the values in the dataset.\n",

    "The mode is the most common value in a dataset. It is the value that appears most frequently. The mode can be useful when there are a few values that occur more frequently than others, but it is not always applicable or unique. If no value occurs more than once, there is no mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose the appropriate measure of central tendency, you should consider the distribution of the dataset and the presence of outliers. If the dataset is normally distributed and does not have outliers, the mean is a good measure of central tendency. If the dataset has outliers or is skewed, the median may be a better measure of central tendency. If the dataset has categorical data or discrete data, the mode may be a more appropriate measure of central tendency."

    "Ans:Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. These measures provide information about how far apart the data points are from each other and from the center of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread of the data, but it can be affected by outliers. For example, if we have a dataset of test scores that range from 60 to 100, the range is 40.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the dataset. It provides a measure of how much the data points are spread out around the mean. A high variance indicates that the data points are widely spread out, while a low variance indicates that the data points are tightly clustered around the mean. For example, if we have a dataset of test scores with a mean of 80 and the differences between each data point and the mean are: 10, 5, -5, -10, the variance is ((10^2 + 5^2 + (-5)^2 + (-10)^2) / 4) = 37.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the spread of the data that is easy to interpret because it is in the same units as the data. A high standard deviation indicates that the data points are widely spread out, while a low standard deviation indicates that the data points are tightly clustered around the mean. For example, if we have the same dataset of test scores as above, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is approximately 6.12."

    "\n",
    "Ans:Skewness in data refers to the extent to which the data is asymmetrical or skewed in one direction or the other from a normal or symmetric distribution. In other words, it measures the degree to which the data deviates from a perfectly symmetrical bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data is perfectly symmetrical, the skewness is zero. If the data is skewed to the right, it has a positive skewness, meaning that the tail of the distribution is longer on the right side than on the left side. If the data is skewed to the left, it has a negative skewness, meaning that the tail of the distribution is longer on the left side than on the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness can have important implications for statistical analysis because it can affect the validity of certain assumptions and tests. For example, if the data is significantly skewed, the mean may not be a representative measure of central tendency, and other measures such as the median or mode may be more appropriate. In addition, skewed data can affect the accuracy of some statistical tests, such as the t-test, which assumes a normal distribution"

    "Ans:If a data set is right-skewed, meaning that it has a long tail to the right of the mean, the median will typically be lower than the mean. This is because the median is the middle value of the data when it is sorted in order, and the long tail to the right can pull the mean higher than the middle value.For example, consider a dataset with the following values:\n",
    "10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 1000\n",
